# NextJS Boilerplate

> Initial structure (boilerplate) developed with NextJS, Jest, React Testing Library, Apollo Client, Cypress, Typed, Storybook, Prettier, Eslint, Husky, Dependabot and Github Actions all configured, with self-updating dependencies and ready for use.

## How to install
To create a copy of this initial structure just open the console on your machine and use the following command: 

```
yarn create next-app -e https://github.com/angelorubin/nextjs-boilerplate.git
```

In this way a new application will be created locally from this boilerplate and you will be able to develop your application quickly and conveniently with a complete structure.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
